## Processing Perfected
While this project is not finished, my aim from the beginning has been to create the most user friendly word processor I can. I'm slowly taking my favorite features from Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, Sublime Text, VSCode, Wordpad, and even Notepad, and combining them into a processor that is satisfying and easy to use! The project isn't finished, it's missing a bunch of features, and it's probably got a few bugs. But by the end, I hope it becomes something that you enjoy using.

The main things I wanted to be certain of was that its code was simple and open-source. So anyone could take the base I've created and use it to make their own word processor that is specific to what they want. Please give credit somewhere in your project if you use my code. Thanks!
